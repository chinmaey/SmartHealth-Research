# SmartHealth-Research

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
The **SmartHealth-Research** project focuses on using sensory data collected from **mobile devices (smartphones and wearables)** to monitor **depression symptoms** and predict **treatment outcomes**. This research contributes to the field of **smart and connected health**, offering data-driven solutions for mental health monitoring using machine learning and time-series analysis. The project includes evaluation of SVM, XGBoost, LSTM, and GRU-D models using transfer learning, feature selection, and explainability analysis with SHAP techniques, as well as experiments with Langchain GPT-4 on an open-source dataset.  

*Note: Due to NIH grant restrictions, the code and data for this project cannot be shared publicly.*

## ðŸ“‚ Research Areas  
This project explores two key directions:

### **1. Predicting Symptom Improvement During Depression Treatment Using Sleep Sensory Data**  
ðŸ”¹ **Key Findings:**  
- Sleep data from **Fitbit devices** is used to predict changes in depression symptoms.  
- A dataset of **28 participants** was analyzed.  
- **â„“1 trend filtering** was applied to extract high-level sleep features from noisy raw data.  
- Evaluated **SVM, XGBoost, Random Forrest** using **feature selection and explainability analysis**.  
- Features such as **mean and standard deviation of sleep duration** showed correlations with self-reported depression scores.  
- Machine learning models achieved an **F1 score of 0.68**, demonstrating the potential of **sleep sensory data in predicting symptom improvement**.

### **2. Using Mobile Daily Mood and Anxiety Self-ratings to Predict Depression Symptom Improvement**  
ðŸ”¹ **Key Findings:**  
- A **daily 5-point Likert-scale** survey for **mood and anxiety** was used for monitoring depression treatment.  
- **67 participants** contributed data via a smartphone app.  
- Mood and anxiety ratings were significantly correlated with self-reported clinical questionnaire scores.  
- Evaluated **SVM, XGBoost, Random Forrest** using **transfer learning, feature selection, and explainability analysis**.  
- Machine learning models trained on these surveys achieved an **F1 score of 0.68**, indicating their reliability in tracking depression symptom improvement.  
- **Prediction accuracy was robust even with missing data**, making daily mood surveys a viable alternative to burdensome clinical questionnaires.
